# Sledding, Skating, and Skiing

We're answering prompt 2, "How do we stay occupied during a snow day?"
We built an app that lets you see all the sledding, skating, and skiing areas near you!
Over a view of your profile, there's a map with each location marked. 
If you click on one in the search, you can see the name of the hill, how far away it is from you, and the amount of XP you can earn from it, or mark it as one of your your favorite locations.
You can make friends, sled, skate, or ski at the best locations near you, and have fun with this app!
