# Snow Day Sledding

This app was made for the BB&N Hackathon 2023. We're answering prompt 2, "How do we stay occupied during a snow day?"

We built an app that lets you see all the sledding, skating, and skiing areas near you! Over a view of your profile, there's a map with each location marked. If you click on one in the search, you can see the name of the hill, how far away it is from you, and the amount of XP you can earn from it, or mark it as one of your your favorite locations. You can make friends, sled, skate, or ski at the best locations near you, and have fun with this app!

#### Find snowy activities!
Click on a location on the map, and you will receive a pop up. It will have the name of the location, the XP you will earn, and where it is.

#### Earn XP!
Each location gives you a certain amount of XP for going! Level up as you earn more XP!

#### Submit new locations!
If there’s a sledding, skiing, or skating location you particularly love but it isn’t on the map, submit it! It will be added on the map soon.
